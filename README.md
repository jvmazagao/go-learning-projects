- **Text editor or IDE**: VS Code, GoLand, Vim, etc.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-learn.git
cd go-learn
```

### 2. Verify Go Installation

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to: `go version go1.21.0 darwin/amd64`

### 3. Navigate to a Project

```bash
cd hello-world    # or variables, calculator, structs, composition, interfaces, player-recorder
```

### 4. Run the Project

```bash
go run *.go
```
