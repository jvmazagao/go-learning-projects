## üéØ Overview

This project demonstrates advanced interface concepts in Go, including interface composition, type assertions, and complex interface hierarchies. It shows how to build sophisticated abstractions by combining multiple interfaces and how to work with different types through complex interface relationships.

This is an advanced project that builds upon basic interface concepts to show real-world interface design patterns.

### Code Explanation

- **`Player` and `Recorder` interfaces**: Basic interfaces for playing and recording
- **`PlayerRecorder` interface**: Composed interface that embeds both `Player` and `Recorder`
- **`Microphone`, `Radio`, `Smartphone`**: Different types implementing various interfaces
- **`Execute()`**: Function that works with types implementing both interfaces
- **`SmartPlay()`**: Demonstrates type assertions to check interface capabilities

## üîë Key Concepts

### 1. Interface Composition
```go
type PlayerRecorder interface {
	Player
	Recorder
}
```
- Combines multiple interfaces into one
- Any type implementing `PlayerRecorder` must implement both `Player` and `Recorder`
- Enables complex interface hierarchies

### 2. Interface Implementation
```go
// Smartphone implements both Player and Recorder
func (s Smartphone) Play() {
	fmt.Println("Playing music on", s.model)
}

func (s Smartphone) Record() {
	fmt.Println("Recording video on", s.model)
}
```
- `Smartphone` implements both `Player` and `Recorder` interfaces
- Can be used wherever `PlayerRecorder` is expected
- Demonstrates multiple interface satisfaction

### 3. Type Assertions
```go
func SmartPlay(p Player) {
	p.Play()

	if recorder, ok := p.(Recorder); ok {
		fmt.Println("I'm can record")
		recorder.Record()
	}
}
```
- Checks if a `Player` also implements `Recorder`
- Safe type assertion with `ok` pattern
- Conditional behavior based on interface capabilities

### 4. Interface Segregation
```go
// Microphone only implements Recorder
func (m Microphone) Record() {
	fmt.Println("Recording from microphone", m.tone)
}

// Radio only implements Player
func (r Radio) Play() {
	fmt.Println("Playing from radio: ", r.station)
}
```
- Different types implement different interfaces
- Follows interface segregation principle
- Allows for focused, single-purpose types

### 5. Polymorphic Functions
```go
func PlayMusic(p Player) {
	p.Play()
}

func RecordAudio(r Recorder) {
	r.Record()
}

func Execute(pr PlayerRecorder) {
	pr.Play()
	pr.Record()
	pr.Stop()
	pr.StopRecording()
}
```
- Functions work with any type implementing the required interface
- Same function works with different concrete types
- Demonstrates polymorphic behavior

## üöÄ How to Run

### Method 1: Direct Execution

1. Navigate to the player-recorder directory:
   ```bash
   cd player-recorder
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   go run recorder.go
   ```

### Method 2: Build and Run

1. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   go build recorder.go
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   # On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS)
   ./recorder
   
   # On Windows
   recorder.exe
   ```

## üì§ Expected Output

```
Playing from radio:  98 FM
Playing music on Iphone
Recording from microphone C
Recording video on Iphone
Playing music on Iphone
I'm can record
Recording video on Iphone
```

**Explanation**:
- First line: Radio playing (only Player interface)
- Second line: Smartphone playing music
- Third line: Microphone recording (only Recorder interface)
- Fourth line: Smartphone recording video
- Fifth line: Smartphone playing music again
- Sixth and seventh lines: SmartPlay function demonstrating type assertion

- **Knowledge of structs and methods** from previous projects
- **Text editor or IDE** (VS Code, GoLand, Vim, etc.)

### Recommended Prerequisites

Complete these projects first:
1. **[Hello World Project](../hello-world/README.md)** - Basic Go syntax
2. **[Variables Project](../variables/README.md)** - Variable handling
3. **[Structs Project](../structs/README.md)** - Structs and methods

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `impossible type assertion`
- **Solution**: The type doesn't implement the interface you're asserting

**Issue**: `cannot use type as interface type`
- **Solution**: Make sure the type implements all required methods

**Issue**: Interface composition not working
- **Solution**: Ensure all embedded interfaces are properly implemented

## üìö Additional Notes

### Interface Design Patterns

**Composition over inheritance**:
```go
// Good - interface composition
type PlayerRecorder interface {
    Player
    Recorder
}

// Bad - large monolithic interface
type BigDevice interface {
    Play()
    Stop()
    Record()
    StopRecording()
    // ... many more methods
}
```

### Type Assertion Best Practices

```go
// Safe type assertion
if recorder, ok := device.(Recorder); ok {
    recorder.Record()
} else {
    fmt.Println("Device cannot record")
}

// Type switch for multiple interfaces
switch v := device.(type) {
case PlayerRecorder:
    v.Play()
    v.Record()
case Player:
    v.Play()
case Recorder:
    v.Record()
default:
    fmt.Println("Unknown device type")
}
```

### Interface Segregation Principle

```go
// Good - focused interfaces
type Player interface {
    Play()
    Stop()
}

type Recorder interface {
    Record()
    StopRecording()
}

// Bad - large interface
type Device interface {
    Play()
    Stop()
    Record()
    StopRecording()
    // Forces all types to implement everything
}
```
